    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Kimchi Udon Noodle Soup is a delicious, hot, spicy, and nourishing soup to warm you up on a cold day. Udon complements kimchi in this simple and tasty recipe.
        Kimchi is a common and revered side dish in Korean cuisine. This dish dates back several hundred years. Kimchi is salted and fermented vegetables. 
        The most common variety in the West is made of cabbage, but Kimchi can be made with Korean radishes, spring onions, and cucumber. 
        Common variations include adding ginger, garlic, gochugaru (Korean chili powder), salted fish, and spices.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are hundreds of varieties of kimchi made with different vegetables as the main ingredients.
         Traditionally, winter kimchi, called kimjang, was stored in large earthenware fermentation vessels,
         called onggi, in the ground to prevent freezing during the winter months and to keep it cool enough to slow down the fermentation process during summer months. 
         The vessels are also kept outdoors in special terraces called jangdokdae. In contemporary times, household kimchi refrigerators are more commonly used.

        It is noted for its strong, spicy, flavours and odours, although milder varieties exist.
        Flavour and odour are intimately connected and non-Koreans often find the smell offensive, but scientists are trying to develop varieties that are not offensive to foreign palates.
